The concept of education is often symbolized by images of classrooms, textbooks, and lectures. However, the idea of education goes beyond those traditional artifacts/representations and expands to include personal development, wisdom from experience, and collaborative learning. This broader perspective of education became particularly important during the COVID-19 era when the conventional schooling system underwent a massive transformation, which prompted a shift towards remote learning, individual research, and virtual collaboration. 
	The onset of the pandemic created an era of self-reliance in education. When schools closed their doors during the initial waves of COVID, the idea of education began to transition from teachers to students. I found myself right in the middle of this new change, in which we were empowered to take the reins in our own education, similar to the way Malcolm X expresses, “I saw the best thing I could do was get a hold of a dictionary-to study, to learn some words.” The transition wasn’t just about self-study, it was a test of motivation and initiative. I embraced this new opportunity to explore the world of digital design, teaching myself Blender3D from scratch through online resources. The greater time between classes and the use of asynchronous learning allowed me more time to explore other interests. This phase in my life wasn't just about learning a new skill; it was about exploring a new world of self-driven learning. 
	The pandemic didn’t just change the mode of individual learning; it also redefined collaborative work. The physical classrooms changed into virtual breakout rooms, where ideas were able to be exchanged more intimately and interactively. The absence of the conventional classroom setting was clear, but the new design of collaborative learning. I took advantage of these opportunities, exchanging resources and reviewing drafts. This experience altered how I thought about learning for the first time in a while. The digital collaboration created a deeper understanding of the content as discussions were created in shared documents or calls. The interactions often went beyond class time, showing the collaborative learning process created a constant educational conversation. 
	Education isn't limited to the knowledge within the classroom; in reality, it’s heavily inspired by real-world experiences. The quote, “You don’t stop learning until you leave the classroom,” resonates with my educational path. This can be seen in how it affected me, especially during the pandemic. The world changes into a classroom where every interaction and experience contributes to the learning process. The pandemic, even with all of its constraints, unknowingly added a ton of learning paths where each encounter contributed to a better understanding of personal development and wisdom through experiences. 
	The COVID-19 pandemic, an unseen tutor, has illustrated the complex nature of education. Education goes beyond the traditional classroom, emphasizing the importance of self-reliance, collaborative learning, and real-world experiences. These all contribute to a well-rounded educational journey. As we go into the future where the lines between traditional schooling and full education are blurred together, the lessons created during this unexpected experience of COVID-19 have the potential to redefine what we consider os an education.
